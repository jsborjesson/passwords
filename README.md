This is a paper on the weaknesses of password-secured systems, and what we as developers can use
instead.

## Guidelines for reviewers

**You can read the work in progress by checking out the appropriate branch.**

There will be a [pull request][] open where you can comment either on the entire section or on a
specific line by going to the `Files changed` tab and clicking the icon to the left of lines:

![](https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/modules/commit/commit_comment_tip.gif)

When commenting on a paragraph, put the line note on the **last** line in the paragraph, this is
because Github will show a snippet of the text _above_ the line when rendering the conversation.

Feedback is welcome in both English and Swedish.

If you have any questions or a problem not directly related to the writing, I suggest you open an
[issue][] instead.

## Process

Each section is written in a branch. When it is time for reviewers to give their opinions, a pull
request is opened where the entire section can be discussed. After this is finished, and any
discussed edits have been made, the pull request will be accepted and a new branch is created for
the next section of the paper.
