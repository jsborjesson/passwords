## Introduction

At the time of writing, the Heartbleed scandal is just about to blow over. Its effects was not
disastrous for me, though no less than annoying. I had unique, randomly generated passwords on every
site, and they were all stored in a password manager with a locally encrypted database. Even if it
was transfered over a vulnerable connection, the key has never been transfered and just one layer of
the encryption would have been endangered.

Changing out all of my passwords took less than an hour, my password manager made it very simple to
generate new ones, but I still had to go through the forms on every single website. I was feeling
pretty happy with myself, this process would have taken me more than three times as long a year ago.

I then remembered that my mother would have to go through this process as well, but her password
manager was a notebook. It was her compromise when I argued that she needed unique passwords, but
she thought password managers were too complicated. Suddenly I wasn't feeling so good about being
able to switch out my passwords on 30 different accounts so quickly. I knew that the few accounts
she needed to change was going to cause her more trouble than all of mine.

Most non technical people will use the same password everywhere, and it will probably be a bad
password (as shown by the leaked password statistics that are exposed every time a big site gets
hacked<!-- TODO: SOURCE -->). We can try to educate people, making them aware that they need to
think about security and that they should install extra software for keeping all of their passwords
safe, but they just want to get into their stuff as smoothly as possible, and be confident that
nobody else will. **Is this really their problem?**

## Background

### Purpose

The purpose of this paper is to explore the negative aspects of password based authentication, and
scratch the surface of its current alternatives. Passwords have been the standard form of
authentication used on the web for as long as I can remember, is it finally time for them to retire?

### Question

**Should passwords as authentication be deprecated?**
